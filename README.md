# Kernel-Learning

# What's the point of this project?

This is my first kernel driver development project...
This project was made for knowledge purpouse only, it contains a warzone cheat that's public based, a driver, a loader and a program used to test communications with the driver

# How it works? 

It contais a loader that run's keyauth's api, as soon as you log-in, the loader automaticaly downloads a target where the dll of the cheat is injected via manual map (there's a communication between the loader and the target via json).

# End

Don't expect the wz2 cheat being undetected, it'll ban you withing 1 hour of playing!
